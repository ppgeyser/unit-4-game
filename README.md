# Crystal Collector

The objective of Crystal Collector is to match your score with the crystal score by adding crystals to your collection. You can collect crystals by clicking on one of the four crystal images. Each crystal has a value that is predetermined before each round. If your score goes over the crystal score, you lose; otherwise if you match your score with the crystal score, you win!

This "Crystal Collector" game is my second project working with javascript/jquery. This project showcases my understanding of variables, arrays, functions, onclick/onkey events, usage of the math.random function, and manipulating the DOM. I also used what I learned in our html and css sections to create a game that is aesthetically pleasing visually and is responsive.
